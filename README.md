# studying-apache-james

What's is the Apache James and what can it do? You can find the answer on there: https://james.apache.org/.

As a programmer, studying Apache James is a great opportunity to improve our architecture and coding skills. 

The project is composed of a series of articles about Apache James, which cover almost all modulars. If you have better ideas, please come along to improve the project together.

Thanks to all the contributors of Apache James source code. Hope we could design more excellent programs by continuing study.
